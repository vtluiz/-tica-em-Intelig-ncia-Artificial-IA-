# AI Ethics Papers Analysis

## Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of a set of research papers focused on AI ethics, sourced from arXiv. It includes data such as the arXiv reference, title, authors, subjects, abstracts, DOI links, and the number of pages. The aim is to extract insights from these papers and generate recommendations on the ethical application and governance of AI technologies.

## Dataset
The dataset contains key metadata for each research paper:
- **arXiv_reference**: Unique reference ID on arXiv.
- **paper_arXiv_link**: Direct link to the paper on arXiv.
- **paper_title**: Title of the paper.
- **paper_authors**: Authors of the paper.
- **paper_subject**: Subject(s) under which the paper is categorized.
- **paper_abstract**: Abstract summarizing the research.
- **paper_doi_link**: DOI link to the paper.
- **paper_number_of_pages**: Total pages in the paper.
- **paper_version_release_date**: Date of the release of the paperâ€™s version.
- **paper_ondatabase_since**: Date since the paper is in the dataset.
- **paper_ondatabase_latest**: The latest update date of the paper in the dataset.
